**CipherX** is an *AI-powered cybersecurity* tool that fine-tunes advanced models like **GPT** and **LLaMA** on cybersecurity datasets. It automates **threat detection**, **password generation**, and **security insights**, helping professionals stay ahead of cyber threats with a **local-first**, **privacy-focused** approach.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

CipherX combines advanced artificial intelligence with cybersecurity expertise to:
- Analyze cybersecurity datasets (e.g., attack logs, password lists, and threat intelligence).
- Fine-tune AI models for threat detection, password generation, and security knowledge.
- Generate actionable insights for cybersecurity professionals, from understanding vulnerabilities to suggesting security enhancements.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features

- **AI-Powered Threat Detection**: Harness the power of GPT-2 and LLaMA to detect patterns in cybersecurity data.
- **Automated Dataset Processing**: Automatically download and preprocess cybersecurity data to train the models.
- **Custom Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune models to work specifically with cybersecurity datasets like passwords, attack vectors, and logs.
- **Local-First Approach**: Operate entirely on local systems, ensuring data privacy and security.
  
## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

CipherX works by fine-tuning pre-trained models on cybersecurity-specific data. This allows the AI to "understand" the language of security and generate insights that can help:
- Create stronger passwords
- Detect potential attack vectors
- Educate on common cybersecurity risks
- Predict trends in cybersecurity

## ðŸš€ Roadmap

- [x] Initial setup and exploration of datasets  
- [ ] Fine-tune models with custom cybersecurity data  
- [ ] Build a user-friendly interface for easier interaction  
- [ ] Extend to support additional datasets like Kaggle and Google Datasets
